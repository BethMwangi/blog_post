####VIM for Python Developers
 I have just been introduced to python and the only source I am using is code academy. So the online editor will not do much for me since I need to practice on how to write python programs locally. It has been a week into python and I have come across several IDE's one can use but I found vim to be interesting. Additionally, I realized I can ditch my mouse when coding(No wastage of time..Yaay!)After researching on it, I  realize it is a powerful tool to get started with Python. 
 
 I am going to explain on how i installed it in my ubuntu.The tutorial is a simple step by step that a newbie can follow. So let's dive in..
