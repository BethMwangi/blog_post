This is my second week into Python and i am very excited to learn more about the language. I have realized it can actually do magic 
quite an easy language to grasp ,i.e from creating web apps to games and dynamic management systems. I am always eager to find new learning material online and practise on my laptop.
The reason for writing this blog is to share the secret to learning good practices in python programming.
Infact, if you want to become an expert python developer, read the documentation. 
The documentation has covered all the coding conventions in Python. Read it cover to cover, then thank me later.
I am going to share some of the few and useful python standards you should know before you start coding. 

### The code style guide
**Indentation**
Examlple :
Let's say you have defined (*def*) a function that prints 2 arguments ,*arg1* and *arg2*, the next line, i.e  >>>>arg1, arg2 = args has 4 spaces indicated by >>>>. The indented lines take up the print_two function.
 Always use 4 spaces per indentation level
 
 ```python
 def print_two(*args):
 >>>>arg1, arg2 = args
 >>>>print "arg1: %r, arg2: %r" %(arg1, arg2)
 
 def print_two_again(arg1, arg2):
    print "arg1: %r, arg2: %r" %(arg1, arg2)

```
